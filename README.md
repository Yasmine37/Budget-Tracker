# Budget-Tracker
I built a Budget Tracker Web App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help users manage their money easily. It lets me add income and expenses, calculate totals, and see my balance. I used localStorage so the data is saved even after logging out, and I focused on making the interface simple, clean, and easy to use.
